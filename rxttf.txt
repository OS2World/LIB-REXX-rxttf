        RxTTF: A procedure for creating bitmaps from TTF fonts.

RxTTF.DLL is an "OS/2 REXX callable" procedure for creating a "bitmap"
image from a character string, using a TTF font.

RxTTF can use any TTF font you may have. Furthermore, you can
specify the point size!

1) Installation:

After obtaining RxTTF, unzip it to an empty temporary directory.
Then, copy RXTTF.DLL to someplace in your LIBPATH (say, x:\OS2\DLL).

2) Usage:

To use RxTTF, you first have to tell your REXX program where to find
it. The following can be used:

    isthere=rxfuncquery('rxttf_image')
    if isthere=1 then do
       call RxFuncAdd 'rxttf_image', 'RXTTF', 'rxttf_image'
    end

The calling syntax of rxttf_image is:

    rc = rxttf_image(message,ttf_file,psize, data)

where
  message : a character string, length is limited to 1024 characters.
  ttf_file: the name of the TTF file you want to use
  ptsize  : the point size of to use
  data    : a variable name to use as a stem variable.
and
   rc =  status code. A zero means success

rxttf_image returns results in the "data" stem variable (you don't have
to use "data", it can be any valid rexx variable name).

   data.!rows =  the number of rows in the image
   data.!cols =  the number of columns in the image

   data.i; where i = 0 to data.!rows-1 : the contents of the "ith" row
                     (where row 0 is the top of the image)

data.i is a character string, with each character representing the value of
the corresponding pixel. In particular, character values of 0 and 1 are used.

Thus: the decimal value of the pixel at the  23 column of the
             9th row of the image is:
                a_value=c2d(substr(data.8,23,1))
             a_value will equal either 0 or 1.
....perhaps these would be more accurately described as "byte maps".

3) Examples:
   rc=rxttf_image("Hello","c:\os2\mdos\winos2\system\times.ttf",12,'data')
   rc=rxttf_image('Gone Fishing",'fishing.ttf',25,'messx')


4) Notes:
 * RxTTF is based on source code produced by the FreeType project:
       http://www.freetype.org/ft_os2/index.html
 * For ambitious C programmers, the source code is also provided.
 * RxTTF is in the public domain.
 * Use RxTTF at your own risk.
 * RXTTF.CMD is a simple "banner text program" that demonstrates how
   to use RxTTF. For a more feature rich version of this banner program,
   please try TTF_TEXT (look on hobbes.nmsu.edu).
